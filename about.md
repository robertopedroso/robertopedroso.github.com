I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Chicago who studies Philosophy
and Computer Science.

My philosophical interests are divided into two tangentially-related fields:

* Philosophy of science, with a particular focus on the problems of induction, causation/causal inference, as well as necessity and contingency.
* Foucault's later period, particularly his articulation of freedom and the relationship of those views with Kant.

I also like building things with software and hardware. On weekends, you'll find
me hacking away at some web project or my Arduino.
